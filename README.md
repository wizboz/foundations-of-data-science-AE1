### The Queen's Gambit

The international Chess Federation (FIDE) is the governing body of the sport of chess.
On its website, ratings.fide.com, FIDE has made available historical monthly chess player ratings for three types of games: standard, rapid and blitz. At kaggle.com, there is a FIDE dataset containing the playersâ€™ ratings per game from January 2016 to April
2021.

The chess.com game dataset available at kaggle.com contains ~275,000 games played online by women grandmasters (WGM) against an opponent who may or may not be a grandmaster, starting from September 2009. 

In this project, I analyse the FIDE dataset and the chess.com data.
